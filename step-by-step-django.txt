* Create a folder
* Inside this folder, with cmd press "python -m venv venv" to create a environment
* Activate a virtual env with command "venv\Scripts\active.bat"
* Create a file ".gitignore" and add a line with "venv" (To ignore venv folder)
* Install django with command "pip install django"
* Create a new project with command "django-admin startproject project_name ."
* In file settings.py change language = 'pt-br', time_zone = 'America/Sao_Paulo', add 'localhost' in ALLOWED_HOSTS
* Run command "python manage.py migrate" to create database
* Run command "python manage.py createsuperuser" to create a new administrator user
* Run server with commnand "python manage.py runserver"
* Create a app with command "python manage.py startapp core" where "core" is a name of app
* And register this app in file "settings.py", inserting 'core,' on last line of "INSTALLED_APPS"
* Create our classes in models.py and run two commands: "python manage.py makemigrations" and "python manage.py migrate"
* In file we will add ours created classes "admin.py", add a line "from .models import Class1, Class2, etc..."
* And register this classes with "admin.site.register(Class1)
				  admin.site.register(Class2)
				  admin.site.register(Class3)"

* Configure "urls.py" of our project like this:
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path, re_path

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^core/', include('core.urls')), # Redirecting url core to our urls.py in core
    re_path(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

* And create a file "urls.py" in our app folder like this:
from django.urls import path, re_path
from .views import home

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r'^$', home, name='core_home')
]

* Now, in views.py of our app, we can create a view like:
from django.shortcuts import render
from  django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    context = {'mensagem': 'Ola mundo'}
    return render(request, 'core/index.html', context)

* Now we configure our folder of templates in settings.py, setting 'DIRS': ['templates']
and create a folder "templates" and inside templates create another folder called "core" (The same name of our application)
and inside "core" we will create a file "index.html"

* Now, in the folder root, we create our folder "templates" and put some files like "base.html" to create our inherted base html
because with the DIRS configured to 'templates', our application will search all paths with name 'templates'
